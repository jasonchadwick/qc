    "This notebook gives an overview of how to simulate several kinds of noise in Pulser. Quantum computers aren't perfect and are susceptible to various sources of noise. In order to realistically simulate these quantum computations, we need to take them into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of now, the types of noise implemented in Pulser are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- SPAM (State Preparation And Measurement) errors : There are three types of such errors, one (with probability $\\eta$) related to bad initial state preparation of the all-ground state $\\Ket{g}^{\\otimes n}$, and two (with probabilities $\\epsilon, \\epsilon '$) linked to detection errors. During the imaging process, excited Rydberg atoms in $\\Ket{r}$ might decay to the state $\\Ket{g}$, allowing them to be trapped in the tweezers : those are the false negatives modeled by $\\epsilon'$. On the contrary, some atoms in $\\Ket{g}$ might get excited due to various causes (collisions...) and tweezer recapture might fail, inferring them incorrectly as atoms in $\\Ket{r}$ : those are the false positives modeled by $\\epsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Doppler damping : The atoms in the register are cooled to a temperature $T \\sim 50\\mu K$, which is low but still non-zero. Therefore, the laser frequency they observe is shifted by Doppler shifting due to thermal motion. This corresponds to a shift in the detuning frequency of the laser, and leads to a damping in the Rydberg population.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Waist of the laser : For global pulses, the laser amplitude has a Gaussian profile and atoms at the border of the waist feel a slightly lower amplitude than those at the focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dephasing / phase-damping: Each qubit interacts with its environment, and we can model this interaction with random $Z$-rotations on each qubit. Given a dephasing probability $p$, this noise model adds two collapse operators $M_0 = \\sqrt{1-\\frac{p}{2}} \\times \\mathbb{1}$, $M_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{p}{2}} \\sigma_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{p}{2}} (\\Ket{r}\\Bra{r} - \\Ket{g}\\Bra{g})$ and forces the solver to adopt a density matrix formalism. See [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/nuclear-engineering/22-51-quantum-theory-of-radiation-interactions-fall-2012/lecture-notes/MIT22_51F12_Ch8.pdf) for a more thorough explanation.\n"
